# dependsOn allows you to configure dependencies to other bundles. The current bundle
# will only be deployed, after all dependencies are deployed and in a Ready state.
dependsOn:
  # Format: <GITREPO-NAME>-<BUNDLE_PATH> with all path separators replaced by "-"
  # Example: GitRepo name "one", Bundle path "/multi-cluster/hello-world" => "one-multi-cluster-hello-world"
  # Note: Bundle names are limited to 53 characters long. If longer they will be shortened:
  # opni-fleet-examples-fleets-opni-ui-plugin-operator-crd becomes opni-fleet-examples-fleets-opni-ui-plugin-opera-021f7
